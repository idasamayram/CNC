\chapter{Neural Network Architectures and Performance Analysis for Vibration-based CNC Condition Monitoring}

\section{Neural Network Architectures for Time Series}

In the context of vibration-based condition monitoring for CNC machining processes, neural network architectures play a crucial role in extracting meaningful patterns from temporal sensor data. This section presents a comprehensive analysis of various neural network approaches specifically designed for time series classification tasks in industrial monitoring applications.

\subsection{Introduction to Classifier Neural Networks for Time Series}

Time series classification in industrial condition monitoring presents unique challenges due to the temporal dependencies, noise characteristics, and varying signal patterns inherent in vibration data. Neural network architectures must be capable of capturing both local temporal features and global patterns while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time monitoring applications.

The vibration data collected from CNC machining processes consists of tri-axial accelerometer measurements sampled at 2 kHz, resulting in high-dimensional time series with complex temporal correlations. Effective neural network architectures for this domain must address several key requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal feature extraction}: Ability to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies
    \item \textbf{Multi-channel processing}: Efficient handling of tri-axial vibration signals (X, Y, Z axes)
    \item \textbf{Noise robustness}: Resilience to industrial noise and measurement artifacts
    \item \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Real-time processing capabilities for online monitoring
    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: Support for explainable AI (XAI) techniques for industrial acceptance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Time Series}

The Multi-Layer Perceptron represents the baseline neural network approach for time series classification. In our implementation, the MLP architecture flattens the entire input time series into a single feature vector, treating the temporal sequence as independent features.

\textbf{Architecture Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input layer: Flattened vibration data (3 $\times$ 2000 = 6000 features)
    \item Hidden layer 1: 256 neurons with ReLU activation
    \item Hidden layer 2: 64 neurons with ReLU activation  
    \item Output layer: 2 neurons for binary classification (good/bad condition)
    \item Regularization: Dropout (p=0.4) applied after each hidden layer
    \item Total parameters: Approximately 1.55M parameters
\end{itemize}

The MLP approach, while conceptually simple, suffers from significant limitations when applied to time series data. The flattening operation destroys temporal relationships and leads to an excessive number of parameters, making the model prone to overfitting and computationally expensive.

\subsection{Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for Time Series}

Temporal Convolutional Networks represent an advancement over traditional RNNs for sequence modeling by employing dilated convolutions to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Our TCN implementation incorporates residual connections and causal convolutions specifically designed for temporal sequence processing.

\textbf{Architecture Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal blocks: 3 levels with dilated convolutions
    \item Hidden channels: 14 per temporal block
    \item Kernel size: 5 for all convolutional layers
    \item Dilation factors: Progressive dilation (1, 2, 4)
    \item Normalization: Batch normalization within temporal blocks
    \item Regularization: Dropout (p=0.3) within temporal blocks
    \item Global pooling: Adaptive average pooling
    \item Total parameters: Approximately 6.4K parameters
\end{itemize}

The TCN architecture provides several advantages over recurrent networks, including parallelizable training, stable gradients, and flexible receptive field control through dilation. However, for the specific characteristics of vibration data, the causal constraints may not be necessary, potentially limiting the model's effectiveness.

\subsection{1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) for Time Series}

1D Convolutional Neural Networks represent the most suitable architecture family for vibration-based time series classification. Unlike MLPs, 1D-CNNs preserve temporal locality through convolutional operations, while avoiding the sequential processing limitations of RNNs.

The general 1D-CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with progressively increasing receptive fields, followed by pooling operations for dimensionality reduction and a classification head for final predictions.

\textbf{Key advantages of 1D-CNNs for vibration analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Translation invariance}: Robust to temporal shifts in fault patterns
    \item \textbf{Local feature extraction}: Effective capture of localized vibration signatures
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical learning}: Progressive abstraction from low-level to high-level features
    \item \textbf{Parameter efficiency}: Shared weights reduce overfitting compared to MLPs
    \item \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Parallelizable convolutions enable fast inference
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed CNN Architectures}

\subsection{CNN in Frequency Domain (CNN1D\_Freq)}

Frequency domain analysis has long been a cornerstone of vibration-based condition monitoring. Our frequency domain CNN processes the magnitude spectrum of vibration signals, leveraging the fact that many mechanical faults manifest as specific frequency patterns.

\textbf{Frequency Transform:}
The input time series undergoes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing:
\begin{equation}
X_f[k] = \left| \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j2\pi kn/N} \right|
\end{equation}

where $x[n]$ represents the time domain signal and $X_f[k]$ represents the magnitude spectrum.

\textbf{Architecture Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: Frequency domain features (3 channels $\times$ 1000 frequency bins)
    \item Conv1D layers: 16, 32, 48 filters with kernel sizes 15, 9, 5 respectively
    \item Normalization: Batch normalization after each convolutional layer
    \item Pooling: MaxPool1D with kernel size 2, stride 2
    \item Global pooling: Adaptive average pooling
    \item Fully connected: 32 hidden units → 2 output classes
    \item Regularization: Dropout (p=0.25)
    \item Total parameters: Approximately 14.9K parameters
\end{itemize}

The frequency domain approach provides interpretable features aligned with traditional vibration analysis techniques, making it particularly valuable for industrial applications where domain expertise is crucial.

\subsection{CNN in Time Domain}

Time domain CNNs process raw vibration signals directly, allowing the network to learn optimal feature representations without human-designed frequency transformations. This approach has shown superior performance in many machine learning applications due to its ability to capture complex temporal patterns.

\subsubsection{1D-CNN-Wide (cnn1d\_wide)}

The 1D-CNN-Wide architecture represents our primary time domain model, designed for optimal balance between performance and interpretability. This model employs progressively wider kernel sizes to capture multi-scale temporal features effectively.

\textbf{Architecture Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: Raw time domain signals (3 channels $\times$ 2000 time steps)
    \item Convolutional layers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conv1D: 16 filters, kernel size 25, padding 12
        \item Conv2D: 32 filters, kernel size 15, padding 7  
        \item Conv3D: 64 filters, kernel size 9, padding 4
    \end{itemize}
    \item Normalization: Group normalization (4 groups per layer)
    \item Pooling: MaxPool1D with kernel size 3, stride 2
    \item Global pooling: Adaptive average pooling
    \item Fully connected: 64 hidden units → 2 output classes
    \item Regularization: Dropout (p=0.3)
    \item Total parameters: Approximately 31.1K parameters
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design Rationale:}
The 1D-CNN-Wide architecture incorporates several design principles optimized for vibration analysis:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Progressive kernel sizes}: Large initial kernels (25) capture broad temporal patterns, while smaller kernels (9) focus on fine-grained features
    \item \textbf{Group normalization}: More stable than batch normalization for small batch sizes common in industrial applications
    \item \textbf{Adaptive pooling}: Ensures consistent output dimensions regardless of input sequence length
    \item \textbf{Moderate depth}: Balances representational power with gradient flow and interpretability
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{1D-CNN-GN (cnn1d\_ds\_wide)}

The 1D-CNN-GN model represents an enhanced version of the 1D-CNN-Wide architecture, incorporating group normalization and optimized hyperparameters for improved stability and performance.

This architecture shares the same structural design as 1D-CNN-Wide but employs group normalization throughout, providing better training stability and improved generalization performance. The model demonstrates superior robustness to varying batch sizes and noise conditions commonly encountered in industrial environments.

\subsection{Selection of 1D-CNN-Wide for XAI Implementation}

The 1D-CNN-Wide architecture was selected as the primary model for Explainable AI (XAI) implementation based on several key factors:

\textbf{Interpretability Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct time domain processing}: Enables gradient-based attribution methods to provide insights directly on raw sensor data
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical feature extraction}: Progressive kernel sizes create interpretable feature hierarchies from local patterns to global signatures
    \item \textbf{Moderate model complexity}: Balance between performance and explainability, avoiding over-parameterization
